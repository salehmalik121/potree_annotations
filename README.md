# Project Title
## potree_annotations
- [Working URL of Project](http://unleash-potree-annotations-bucket.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/)
## Description
This project is designed to manage annotations using AWS services. It utilizes Terraform for infrastructure management and JavaScript for the application logic.

## Prerequisites
- Terraform installed on your machine
- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- Node.js installed

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd test-annotations
```

### 2. Set Up Terraform
- Navigate to the directory containing your Terraform files.
- Initialize Terraform:
```bash
tf init
```

### 3. Apply Terraform Configuration
- Run the following command to create the necessary infrastructure:
```bash
tf apply
```
- Confirm the action when prompted. This will set up the API Gateway and other resources.

### 4. Configure API Gateway
- After applying Terraform, go to the AWS Management Console.
- Navigate to the API Gateway service.
- Find the API created by Terraform and note the URL endpoint.

### 5. Update `shared.js`
- Open the `shared.js` file located in the project root.
- Add the API Gateway URL to the appropriate section in the file:
```javascript
const apiUrl = '<YOUR_API_GATEWAY_URL>';
```
- Replace `<YOUR_API_GATEWAY_URL>` with the actual URL you copied from the API Gateway.

## Project Structure

This project consists of several files, each serving a specific purpose:

- **api.js**: Contains the main API logic for handling requests and responses.
- **eventListner.js**: Manages event listeners for user interactions and API calls.
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the application.
- **infrastruture.tf**: Terraform configuration file that defines the infrastructure resources needed for the project.
- **main.js**: The main JavaScript file that initializes the application and ties together various components.
- **services.js**: Contains service functions that interact with the API and handle data processing.
- **shared.js**: A shared module that contains common functions and constants used across the application.
- **terraform.tfstate**: The state file generated by Terraform that keeps track of the resources created.
- **AWS/**: Directory containing AWS Lambda functions for managing annotations:
  - **add-annotation.mjs**: Function to add a new annotation.
  - **delete-annotation.mjs**: Function to delete an existing annotation.
  - **get-annotation.mjs**: Function to retrieve an annotation by its ID.
  - **update-annotation.mjs**: Function to update an existing annotation.
- **build/**: Contains the built assets for the application, including libraries and resources.
- **cloudpoint/**: Contains cloud-related functionalities and data processing scripts.
- **libs/**: Directory containing third-party libraries used in the project.

## Usage
- After setting up the API URL, you can serve the application using a simple HTTP server.
- To serve the `index.html` file, you can use a tool like `http-server` or `live-server`.

### Using `http-server`
1. Install `http-server` globally if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```bash
   http-server .
   ```
3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to view the application.

### Using `live-server`
1. Install `live-server` globally if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   npm install -g live-server
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```bash
   live-server .
   ```
3. Your default browser will open automatically to view the application.
